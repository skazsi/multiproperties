== Note ==
The previous [#0.9.0 0.9.0] version used invalid MultiProperties file format version value. Such a `.multiproperties` should be modified manually before trying to open it with the [#0.9.1 0.9.1] version. Ensure that the `.multiproperties` file has `1.0` value in the `Version` element in the beginning part of the XML instead of `2.0`.
