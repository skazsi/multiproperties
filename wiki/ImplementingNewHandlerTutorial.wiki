#summary How to implement new handler

= Introduction =
This tutorial wiki page describes how you can implement a new handler. The description assumes that you are familiar with the Eclipse *plugin development* on basic level and in some cases with *SWT*.

== Goal of the handler ==
By the end of this tutorial we will get a new handler which is able to produce any kind of text based files from the columns. The content of the lines in the files are specified by the handler configuration, having constant values with markers to the actual values. To make it clear or easier to understand why is it usefull, imagine the following need.
We have a `localization` named database table with the below seen structure.
<code language="sql">
CREATE TABLE localization(
  key varchar NOT NULL,
  lang varchar NOT NULL,
  value varchar,
  CONSTRAINT pk_localization PRIMARY KEY (key,lang)
);
</code>
When we save the MultiProperties content having *EN* and *DE* columns, we would like to produce the following SQL file for the *EN* column...
<code language="sql">
DELETE localization WHERE lang = 'EN';
 When we save the MultiProperties content having *EN* and *DE* columns, we would like to produce the following SQL file for the *EN* column.
<code language="sql">
DELETE localization WHERE lang = 'EN';

-- comment line
INSERT INTO localization VALUES ('fruit.apple', 'EN', 'Apple');
INSERT INTO localization VALUES ('fruit.plum', 'EN', 'Plum');
COMMIT;

-- comment line
INSERT INTO localization VALUES ('fruit.apple', 'EN', 'Apple');
INSERT INTO localization VALUES ('fruit.plum', 'EN', 'Plum');

...and the following SQL file for the *DE* column.
<code language="sql">
DELETE localization WHERE lang = 'EN';

-- comment line
INSERT INTO localization VALUES ('fruit.apple', 'EN', 'Apple');
INSERT INTO localization VALUES ('fruit.plum', 'EN', 'Plum');
COMMIT;
